# Variable-Reduction
This repo is a in depth and a complete work in the field of reducing the variabels on any data inputted by the user. For the sake of simplicity, I have assumed the data types of the columns to be integer, float and object. The codes are done in Python. There are many ways to reduce columns from a dataset from which I have chosen the following ones :
1. Missing Value Percentage
2. Low Variance Filter
3. High Correlation 
4. Using Random Forest Feature Importance
5. Forward feature selection
6. Backward Feature Elimination
7. Clustering
8. Stepwise Elimination
9. IV values
